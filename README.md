I used the onetwopunch.sh script from superkojiman as inspiration for this in an effort to learn python...

My goal is to have the following features:
1. Same functionality as onetwopunch.sh
2. Handle CIDR
3. Self generating config file in case you want to use a specific nmap/unicornscan and options
4. I'll be happy is I get to #1...
